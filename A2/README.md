
I started with the domain warping example from TBOS(https://thebookofshaders.com/13/). After changing matrix values in the fbm function, I thought the shader started to look like flames. I added 3 layers of color to the shader a base of yellow, secondary of red and black highlights. The colors can be changes using Tweakpane color pickers. The mix slider mixes webcam video and the shader. Flame size has a zoom effect and the jitter dropdown adds sin motion to the shader. I like the colors I chose, but it also looks best with greens and purple as a secondardy.
