
This shader started with the domain warping example from TBOS(https://thebookofshaders.com/13/). After changing matrix values in the fbm function, I thought the shader started to resemble flames. Three layers of color were added to the shader, a base of yellow, secondary of red and black highlights. The colors can be changes using Tweakpane color pickers. The mix slider mixes webcam video and the shader. Flame size has a zoom effect and the jitter dropdown adds sin motion to the shader. I wanted the initial colors to look real, the colors were selected from an image of a burning log. The effect looks best with green and purple as secondardy color.
