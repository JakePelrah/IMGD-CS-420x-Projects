
This shader started with the domain warping example from TBOS(https://thebookofshaders.com/13/). After changing matrix values in the fbm function, I thought the shader started to resemble flames. Three layers of color were added to the shader, a base of yellow, secondary of red and black highlights. The colors can be changed using Tweakpane color pickers. The mix slider mixes webcam video and the shader. Flame size has a zoom effect and the jitter dropdown adds motion to the shader and adds to flame effect. I wanted the initial colors to look real, so the colors were selected from an image of a burning log. The effect also looks best with green and purple as a secondardy color. Moving forward with this assignment, I would look more into changing the direction of flow and the speed of the ripples.


I asked my wife for feedback. She likes the color picker and prefered pinks and yellows. She thought the base color didn't work, it contributes to the shader but it's subtle depending on the other colors. She tried dragging Tweakpane around and it wouldn't / does not move. This is something I need to explore further, I need to read more of the Tweakpane documentation to see how to make this happen.
