I composed my visuals around the song Flashlight by Parliment. I started by modifying the line examples from "The Book of Shaders".The lines has and inner core and an outer glow that was acheived using different smoothstep values. I wanted to incorporate the FFT, I did so using the smoothstep function to create a bar visualization of the songs bass, midLows, midHighs and highs. 

To control the animation I used the mouses x coordinate, moving the mouse to the right will mix the bars and the neon waves. Moving further right, we enter a shader I created with sin and cos functions. I wish the final transition was better, it's too abrupt. Also, the song is too long for the amount of transitions/ different visualizations. If I were to continue with this project, I may fade the track after 2 minutes or try and improve upon the final transition.
